# TwitterService

This is a project that will be used to prototype accessing the Twitter feed.
It will use the Stream API to make twitter elements available to any client.
The elements can be acquired using the Sockets.IO node.js code base.

See <i>Index.html</i> for a simple client use of the service.

Data will initially be available on port 8888.
